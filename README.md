## Kerri McMahon

I'm an aspiring Software Engineer living in London. Having moved from Cape Town, South Africa at the beginning of 2019, I went from working as a Content Producer, to a Marketing Manager and have now made the decision to start my journey in tech. My greatest achievement so far has been establishing myself in London and finally discovering a career path which will allow me to spend my days creative problem solving and hopefully, one day, finding innovative ways to use tech for good.

## Skills

#### Adaptability

- I discovered how quick I am to adapt and learn new skills primarily during my time at One Avenue Group
- I started this role with very little experience in marketing and very quickly had to learn skills to assist me in creating content and driving informed decisions as the business' sole Marketing Manager 
- The onset of COVID-19 particularly tested this ability, in a matter of weeks I helped to produce two documents for the business detailing every measure we were taking to enhance the safety and hygiene of our workspaces: https://oneavenuegroup.com/covid-19-landing/
- The flexible office space industry was massively impacted by the pandemic, and meant I had to shift my strategy multiple times and think on my feet, especially when it came to prioritising certain marketing activities 

#### Self Awareness 

- I'd say this is a pretty unusual skill to list on a CV, but when it comes to admitting faults and reflecting on my own progress I would say this is a particularly strong skill of mine
- This first came about during my time at MarketForceLive when my then Manager told me I was refreshingly self-aware (hopefully not self-deprecating) in my quarterly reviews where I had to list the areas where I believe I needed improvement
- I consider this one of my greatest strengths because of how it allows me take control of my learning and development in life and in my career

## Education

- In that year I took courses on Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology and Psychology
